# Cosmos3 Reasoner Fine-Tuning (SFT)

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of the Cosmos3 Reasoner on your own data. Tested on 8×H100 (80 GB).

| Recipe | Launch shell | Dataset | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alignment SFT (LLaVA-OneVision) | `launch_sft_llava_ov.sh` | [lmms-lab/LLaVA-OneVision-Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmms-lab/LLaVA-OneVision-Data) | Streams from HF; Cosmos3-Nano Reasoner checkpoint auto-prepared |
| Physical-plausibility SFT (VideoPhy-2) | `launch_sft_videophy2_nano.sh` | [videophysics/videophy2_train](https://huggingface.co/datasets/videophysics/videophy2_train) | 1–5 plausibility scoring; dataset + checkpoint auto-prepared |
| Physical-plausibility SFT (VideoPhy-2, Cosmos3-Super) | `launch_sft_videophy2_super.sh` | [videophysics/videophy2_train](https://huggingface.co/datasets/videophysics/videophy2_train) | Cosmos3-Super tier — Qwen3-VL-32B full fine-tune; dataset + checkpoint auto-prepared |
| Physical-plausibility SFT (VideoPhy-2, Cosmos3-Edge) | `launch_sft_videophy2_edge.sh` | [videophysics/videophy2_train](https://huggingface.co/datasets/videophysics/videophy2_train) | Cosmos3-Edge tier — Nemotron-2B-Dense-VL (SigLIP2 tower, frozen); dataset auto-prepared; reasoner weights load directly from the (ungated) `nvidia/Cosmos3-Edge` snapshot |

All use `[job].task = "vlm"`. The Nano recipes bootstrap from a Cosmos3-Nano Reasoner checkpoint; the Cosmos3-Super recipe bootstraps from a Cosmos3-Super Reasoner checkpoint (Cosmos3-Super LM merged onto the Qwen3-VL-32B visual tower); the Nano/Super checkpoints are auto-prepared on first run. The Cosmos3-Edge recipe loads its reasoner weights (Edge's own Nemotron-2B-Dense-VL LM + SigLIP2 reasoner tower) directly from the public `nvidia/Cosmos3-Edge` snapshot at startup — no conversion step.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install the framework.** These recipes drive `cosmos_framework.scripts.train`, so install a cosmos-framework checkout first — follow the shared [Cosmos Framework setup](../../README.md#cosmos-framework) (clone into `packages/cosmos3`, then `uv sync --all-extras --group=cu130-train`; use `cu128-train` on a CUDA 12.x driver).
2. **Recommended container.** For a curated CUDA + PyTorch base, NVIDIA recommends starting from the NGC PyTorch container **`nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.09-py3`** (CUDA 13; use **`:25.06-py3`** for a CUDA 12.8 driver). See the framework [setup guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cosmos-framework/blob/main/docs/setup.md#recommended-base-image).
3. **Activate** the framework venv so `cosmos_framework` is importable: `source <path-to>/packages/cosmos3/.venv/bin/activate`.
4. **Hugging Face access.** The Cosmos3-Nano base checkpoint and datasets are fetched from HF — authenticate once with `uvx hf@latest auth login` (or export `HF_TOKEN`); accept any dataset terms first.
5. **Run from this directory** (`cookbooks/cosmos3/reasoner/finetune/`). Any downloads, converted checkpoints, and run outputs default to `data/`, `checkpoints/`, and `outputs/` here.

## Quick start

Each launcher is a complete recipe — just run it from this folder:

```shell
bash launch_sft_llava_ov.sh          # alignment SFT; dataset streams from HF, builds the Cosmos3-Nano Reasoner checkpoint, then trains
# or
bash launch_sft_videophy2_nano.sh    # first run materializes VideoPhy-2 + builds the Cosmos3-Nano Reasoner checkpoint, then trains
# or (Cosmos3-Super tier — Qwen3-VL-32B full fine-tune)
bash launch_sft_videophy2_super.sh   # first run materializes VideoPhy-2 + builds the Cosmos3-Super Reasoner checkpoint, then trains
# or (Cosmos3-Edge tier — Nemotron-2B-Dense-VL, 2B; also fits a 4-GPU node)
bash launch_sft_videophy2_edge.sh    # first run materializes VideoPhy-2, then trains (reasoner weights load directly from nvidia/Cosmos3-Edge)
```

The VideoPhy-2 download/convert steps are skipped once their outputs exist (Edge has no convert step — its weights stream from the HF cache). Paths are fixed at the top of each script — edit them there to relocate data or checkpoints.

These recipes default to 8 GPUs. On a 4-GPU node (e.g. GB200×4), set `--nproc_per_node=4` on the `torchrun` line in the launch script.

## LoRA fine-tuning

LoRA freezes the reasoner backbone and trains small low-rank adapters on the LLM attention projections, so only the adapters carry optimizer state — which is what makes the 32B Super tier comfortable on a 4-GPU allocation.

Every recipe above is a full fine-tune, but LoRA is a **TOML-level switch**: no code change and no separate LoRA experiment to register. Keep `[job].experiment` on the recipe you started from (`videophy2_sft_nano` / `_super` / `_edge`, or `pre_exp012_llava_ov` for the LLaVA-OneVision recipe) and change `[job].name` so the run gets its own output directory. The generator cookbook's [`launch_sft_vision_super.sh`](../../generator/audiovisual/finetune/launch_sft_vision_super.sh) is a ready-made LoRA recipe driven by the same mechanism on the `vfm` side — worth reading alongside.

Copy the recipe's TOML and touch two places:

| TOML section | Change | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[model]` | `lora_enabled = true`, plus `lora_rank` / `lora_alpha` / `lora_target_modules` | injects the adapters before FSDP wraps the network |
| `[optimizer]` | `keys_to_select = ["lora_"]`, and raise `lr` | trains the adapters only; they start at zero and are a tiny fraction of the parameters, so they take a larger LR than the full-FT recipe's |

For the reasoner backbones the targets are the LLM attention projections — the rank/alpha below are an example to start from, not a required setting:

```toml
lora_enabled        = true
lora_rank           = 16     # e.g. — larger rank buys capacity at the cost of more trainable params
lora_alpha          = 32     # e.g. — commonly around 2x rank
lora_target_modules = "q_proj,k_proj,v_proj,o_proj"
```

Names are matched against the *live* module tree, not checkpoint keys, and these four cover both Qwen3-VL (Nano/Super) and the Cosmos3-Edge reasoner; adding the MLP projections (`gate_proj,up_proj,down_proj` on Qwen3-VL, `up_proj,down_proj` on Edge) is the usual way to buy more capacity. For the LR, start from the recipe's full-FT value and go up — for example, ~5× (`1e-6` → `5e-6`).

**On Cosmos3-Edge add one more line:** `lora_exclude_path_regex = "^model\\.visual\\."`. Its SigLIP2 vision tower names three of its four projections `q_proj`/`k_proj`/`v_proj` too, so name matching alone would also adapt the tower the recipe deliberately freezes — and the run would look healthy while training the wrong subnetwork.

Nothing else *has* to change: `[model.ema].enabled` and `[model.compile].enabled` are already `false` in these recipes (LoRA injection subclasses `nn.Linear`, so keep compile off), and `[checkpoint].keys_to_skip_loading` stays `[]` — the VLM backbone loads from HF safetensors, not from a DCP checkpoint that could carry stale adapter keys. Separately from LoRA, the VideoPhy-2 recipes are short smoke runs (`[trainer].max_iter = 50`), so a real run also wants a higher `max_iter` with `[scheduler].cycle_lengths` matched to it.

Then copy the matching launch shell and point `--sft-toml` at the new TOML; data prep and checkpoint preparation are unchanged.

The VideoPhy-2 recipes enable the HF export callback, so every checkpoint save also writes an HF snapshot next to the DCP checkpoint. That snapshot is an ordinary HF checkpoint even for a LoRA run — the callback merges each adapter into its base weight (`W + (alpha/r) · B·A`), so it carries no `lora_*` keys and loads exactly like a full fine-tune's. Gathering the whole backbone on rank 0 per save is wasted work on a short convergence run, so pass `-- checkpoint.hf_export.enabled=false` on the `torchrun` line while you're only watching loss curves.

## Outputs

Training writes to `outputs/train/<project>/<group>/<name>/`:

- `checkpoints/iter_<N>/` — DCP checkpoint (model / optim / scheduler / trainer state); `checkpoints/latest_checkpoint.txt` names the newest.
- `config.yaml`, launch metadata, logs, and one directory per registered callback.

## Export to Hugging Face safetensors

```shell
RUN_DIR=outputs/train/<project>/<group>/<name>
CKPT=$RUN_DIR/checkpoints/$(cat "$RUN_DIR/checkpoints/latest_checkpoint.txt")
python -m cosmos_framework.scripts.export_model \
    --checkpoint-path "$CKPT" --config-file "$RUN_DIR/config.yaml" -o "$RUN_DIR/model"
```

Use the exported `$RUN_DIR/model` with the [reasoner inference cookbook](../README.md).

> SFT here is a multi-GPU `torchrun` job, so these cookbooks ship as launch scripts + this README rather than a one-click notebook.
