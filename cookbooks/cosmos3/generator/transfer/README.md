# Cosmos3 Generator Transfer Examples

Cosmos3 video **transfer** examples — **Nano** (single GPU) and **Super** (multi-GPU, 32B) — on
the native PyTorch (Cosmos Framework) path, the Diffusers modular pipeline, and the
OpenAI-compatible vLLM-Omni server path.
Sample assets under [`assets/`](./assets) cover spatial control signals paired with
`prompt.json` files:

- **Edge (Canny)** — edge map control plus caption.
- **Blur** — blurred-reference control plus caption.
- **Depth** — depth map control plus caption.
- **Segmentation** — segmentation map control plus caption.
- **World scenario (WSM)** — world-scenario map control plus caption.
- **Multi-control** — two or more hints; Cosmos Framework also supports per-hint weights.

Both Cosmos Framework and vLLM-Omni support multi-control transfer. Per-hint
weighting is supported only by Cosmos Framework; vLLM-Omni accepts multiple
controls but does not support per-hint weights. Diffusers accepts multiple
precomputed controls, also without per-hint weights.

Environment setup is centralized in the shared
[Cosmos3 cookbooks environment setup](../../README.md) guide.

## Transfer Definition

Video transfer generates a target clip from a `prompt.json` caption and one or more
spatial control signals. The Framework path uses `model_mode` `video2video` in a local JSON spec.
The vLLM-Omni path uses `POST /v1/videos/sync` and passes one or more hint keys (`edge`, `blur`,
`depth`, `seg`, or `wsm`) inside `extra_params`. Cosmos Framework accepts pre-computed
control videos (`control_path`) or derives active controls from a raw source video
(`vision_path`). With vLLM-Omni, pass pre-computed controls through `control_path`; edge
and blur controls can also be derived from an uploaded `input_reference`. Output frame
count and geometry come from the control video; see the spec field reference for how
`fps` and `aspect_ratio` are resolved. All examples share `assets/negative_prompt.json`
for the negative caption.

| Control | Asset folder | Inference input | Generation duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Edge (Canny) | `assets/edge/` | `control_edge.mp4` + `prompt.json` | 121 frames @ 30 FPS |
| Blur | `assets/blur/` | `control_blur.mp4` + `prompt.json` | 121 frames @ 30 FPS |
| Depth | `assets/depth/` | `control_depth.mp4` + `prompt.json` | 121 frames @ 30 FPS |
| Segmentation | `assets/seg/` | `control_seg.mp4` + `prompt.json` | 121 frames @ 30 FPS |
| World scenario (WSM) | `assets/wsm/` | `control_wsm.mp4` + `prompt.json` | 101 frames @ 10 FPS |
| Multi-control | `assets/multi_control/` | `vision_path` + multiple hints (Framework example) | 121 frames @ 30 FPS |

Transfer inference is selected automatically when any hint key is present in the
Framework spec or in vLLM-Omni `extra_params`.
The same spec files are used for both Nano and Super — model selection is controlled
entirely by `--checkpoint-path`.

> **PAIBench-C reproduction**: The checked-in specs (`specs/*.json`) with `--seed 2026`
> are the canonical inference recipe used for the PAIBench-C results in the Cosmos3 report.
> Prompts follow the structured `prompt.json` format shown in `assets/*/`. For the full
> benchmark run, use the same per-clip seed (`2026`) for all clips. Evaluation
> reproducibility is tracked separately at

## Run with Cosmos Framework

### Quickstart — Single-control transfer

Set up the environment: [Cosmos Framework setup](../../README.md#cosmos-framework).
Run the commands below inside the **cosmos container** (e.g. `pytorch:25.09-py3`) — the same
environment used to install the venv and run the notebook. The commands mirror the notebook
exactly: `cd` into the framework repo first, then invoke the venv's Python or torchrun
(the system Python does not have `cosmos_framework`).

```bash
# Set once — the cosmos-framework repo root (contains .venv/ and pyproject.toml).
# In this cosmos checkout: packages/cosmos3 (or packages/cosmos-framework).
export COSMOS_FRAMEWORK=/path/to/cosmos-framework   # e.g. <cosmos_root>/packages/cosmos3
export TRANSFER_ROOT=$(pwd)/cookbooks/cosmos3/generator/transfer

# NGC containers bundle libtorch in LD_LIBRARY_PATH which conflicts with Triton/CUDA.
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

#### Cosmos3-Nano (single GPU)

```bash
cd "$COSMOS_FRAMEWORK"

# edge — replace edge.json with blur.json / depth.json / seg.json / wsm.json for other controls
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \
.venv/bin/python -m cosmos_framework.scripts.inference \
  --parallelism-preset=latency \
  -i "$TRANSFER_ROOT/specs/edge.json" \
  -o "$TRANSFER_ROOT/outputs/Cosmos3-Nano/" \
  --checkpoint-path Cosmos3-Nano \
  --seed 2026
```

#### Cosmos3-Super (multi-GPU)

```bash
cd "$COSMOS_FRAMEWORK"

# edge — replace edge.json with other control specs as needed
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 \
.venv/bin/torchrun --nproc-per-node=4 \
  --master-addr=127.0.0.1 --master-port=29500 \
  -m cosmos_framework.scripts.inference \
  --parallelism-preset=latency \
  -i "$TRANSFER_ROOT/specs/edge.json" \
  -o "$TRANSFER_ROOT/outputs/Cosmos3-Super/" \
  --checkpoint-path Cosmos3-Super \
  --seed 2026
```

| | Cosmos3-Nano | Cosmos3-Super |
|---|---|---|
| `--checkpoint-path` | `Cosmos3-Nano` | `Cosmos3-Super` |
| Launcher | `.venv/bin/python` (from framework root) | `.venv/bin/torchrun --nproc-per-node=<N>` (from framework root) |
| `--parallelism-preset` | `latency` | `latency` |
| GPUs | 1 | 4+ |

The input spec sets `prompt_path` and a hint block with `control_path` pointing at the
checked-in assets under [`assets/`](./assets) via paths relative to [`specs/`](./specs).

Outputs are written under the directory passed to `-o`, with one subdirectory per sample
name, e.g. `outputs/Cosmos3-Nano/transfer_edge/vision.mp4`.

### Notebook (self-contained)

[`run_video_transfer_with_cosmos_framework.ipynb`](./run_video_transfer_with_cosmos_framework.ipynb)
is a self-contained tutorial: it installs all dependencies (system packages, framework
clone, Python venv via `uv`), authenticates with Hugging Face, and runs all six controls
with previews.

1. Open the notebook and edit **§2 (Configure)** — paste your `HF_TOKEN` and optionally
   set cache/output paths.
2. Run **§9–§13** for Cosmos3-Nano single-control (single GPU), **§14–§18** for Cosmos3-Super
   single-control (multi-GPU), or **§19** for multi-control (Nano).
   No model flag needed — each section uses its matching checkpoint explicitly.

To execute headlessly:

```bash
cd cookbooks/cosmos3/generator/transfer
jupyter execute run_video_transfer_with_cosmos_framework.ipynb
```

Outputs land under `outputs/notebooks/<model>/transfer_<control>/vision.mp4`.

## Run with Diffusers

### Quickstart

Set up the environment: [Diffusers setup](../../README.md#diffusers). Transfer is
reachable only through the modular pipeline, which takes precomputed control videos as
`control_videos={hint: frames}`:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

import torch
from diffusers import Cosmos3OmniModularPipeline
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video, load_video

transfer_root = Path("cookbooks/cosmos3/generator/transfer")
prompt = json.dumps(json.load(open(transfer_root / "assets/depth/prompt.json")))
negative = json.dumps(json.load(open(transfer_root / "assets/negative_prompt.json")))

pipe = Cosmos3OmniModularPipeline.from_pretrained("nvidia/Cosmos3-Nano", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
pipe.load_components(torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
pipe.enable_safety_checker()
pipe.to("cuda")

videos = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative,
    control_videos={"depth": load_video(str(transfer_root / "assets/depth/control_depth.mp4"))},
    control_guidance=1.5,
    num_frames=121,
    num_video_frames_per_chunk=121,
    num_conditional_frames=1,
    height=720,
    width=1280,
    fps=30.0,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    guidance_scale=3.0,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(2026),
    output="videos",
)
export_to_video(videos, "/tmp/cosmos3_transfer_depth.mp4", fps=30, macro_block_size=1)
```

To run **Cosmos3-Super** instead, load the larger checkpoint:
`Cosmos3OmniModularPipeline.from_pretrained("nvidia/Cosmos3-Super", ...)`.

### Diffusers notebook walkthrough

[`run_video_transfer_with_diffusers.ipynb`](./run_video_transfer_with_diffusers.ipynb) is
the full tutorial for the Diffusers backend: it provisions a dedicated venv, then runs
edge, blur, depth, segmentation, and world-scenario-map transfer on Cosmos3-Nano followed
by the same five controls on Cosmos3-Super. It reads the same [`specs/`](./specs) files and
reuses the previews from [`preview_helpers.py`](./preview_helpers.py), writing outputs to
`outputs/notebooks/diffusers/<model>/transfer_<control>/vision.mp4`.

## Run with vLLM-Omni

### Quickstart

vLLM-Omni accepts multiple control hints in one request, but does not support
the per-hint `weight` field available in Cosmos Framework.

Set up the environment and start the server:
[vLLM-Omni setup](../../README.md#vllm-omni). Transfer controls are available from
vLLM-Omni `main` and the released `vllm/vllm-omni:cosmos3` container. Check the current
[Cosmos3-Nano recipe](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/blob/main/recipes/cosmos3/Cosmos3-Nano.md)
before selecting an image. For Docker, run the command from the `cosmos` repo root so
the repo is mounted at `/workspace` and the server runs from that directory inside the
container:

```bash
export COSMOS3_WORKDIR="$(pwd)"
export COSMOS3_HOST_PORT=8000
```

The transfer examples send repo-local `control_path` strings to the server. For
Docker, those paths must be visible from the server working directory. With the
shared Docker setup, the checked-in depth control video is:

```text
cookbooks/cosmos3/generator/transfer/assets/depth/control_depth.mp4
```

If your server does not run from the repo root, start it from the repo root or
adjust `control_path` to a path the server process can read.

Transfer requests should also pass the spec `resolution` inside `extra_params`.
Cosmos3 transfer bucket selection reads `extra_params.resolution` and the
control/input aspect ratio; set the video API `size` field to the matching
`<width>x<height>` value for a consistent request.

Send a depth-transfer request:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

import requests

transfer_root = Path("cookbooks/cosmos3/generator/transfer")
prompt = json.dumps(json.load(open(transfer_root / "assets/depth/prompt.json")))
negative = json.dumps(json.load(open(transfer_root / "assets/negative_prompt.json")))
control_path = transfer_root / "assets/depth/control_depth.mp4"

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/v1/videos/sync",
    data={
        "prompt": prompt,
        "negative_prompt": negative,
        "size": "1280x720",
        "num_frames": "121",
        "fps": "30",
        "num_inference_steps": "50",
        "guidance_scale": "3.0",
        "flow_shift": "10.0",
        "seed": "2026",
        "extra_params": json.dumps(
            {
                "use_resolution_template": False,
                "use_duration_template": False,
                "guardrails": True,
                "depth": {"control_path": control_path.as_posix()},
                "resolution": "720",
                "control_guidance": 1.5,
                "num_video_frames_per_chunk": 121,
                "max_frames": 121,
            }
        ),
    },
    headers={"Accept": "video/mp4"},
)
response.raise_for_status()
Path("/tmp/cosmos3_transfer_depth.mp4").write_bytes(response.content)
```

### Spec field reference

A representative spec (`specs/edge.json`):

```json
{
  "name": "transfer_edge",
  "model_mode": "video2video",
  "resolution": "720",
  "aspect_ratio": "16,9",
  "num_frames": 121,
  "fps": 30,
  "num_video_frames_per_chunk": 121,
  "num_conditional_frames": 1,
  "num_first_chunk_conditional_frames": 0,
  "share_vision_temporal_positions": true,
  "guidance": 3.0,
  "control_guidance": 1.5,
  "negative_prompt_file": "../assets/negative_prompt.json",
  "prompt_path": "../assets/edge/prompt.json",
  "edge": {
    "control_path": "../assets/edge/control_edge.mp4",
    "preset_edge_threshold": "medium"
  }
}
```

Key fields:

- **`resolution`** — target resolution (e.g. `720` for 720p).

- **`aspect_ratio`** — aspect ratio of the control video; together with `resolution` determines the spatial dimensions (e.g. `720` + `16,9` → 1280 × 720).

- **`fps`** — model conditioning signal and playback rate of the saved output video. Should match the native fps of the control video.

- **`num_frames`** — number of video frames.

### Cookbook entrypoints

- [`run_video_transfer_with_cosmos_framework.ipynb`](./run_video_transfer_with_cosmos_framework.ipynb) —
  self-contained notebook: §9–§13 Nano single-control, §14–§18 Super single-control, §19 multi-control (Nano). Edit §2, run top-to-bottom.
- [`run_video_transfer_with_diffusers.ipynb`](./run_video_transfer_with_diffusers.ipynb) —
  full tutorial for the Diffusers modular pipeline: five single-control transfers on Nano,
  then the same five on Super, driven by the same specs.
- [`run_video_transfer_with_vllm_omni.ipynb`](./run_video_transfer_with_vllm_omni.ipynb) —
  full tutorial against an already-running vLLM-Omni server: endpoint checks, repo-local
  control paths, five single-control transfer requests, and compact previews. The API
  also accepts unweighted multi-control requests by including multiple hint blocks in
  `extra_params`.
- [`specs/`](./specs) — checked-in Framework input JSON per control (paths relative to `specs/`).
  Shared by both Nano and Super.

### Troubleshooting

If inference fails inside attention with a NATTEN/libnatten error, verify that the active Python
environment uses a matching Torch and NATTEN build. Avoid mixing a container-provided Torch/NATTEN
stack with packages from `~/.local` or another venv. In containerized environments,
`PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1` can help prevent user-site packages from shadowing the container stack.
